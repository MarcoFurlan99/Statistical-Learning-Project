# Statistical Learning Project
## The Superstore Dataset

Our project for the Statistical Learning course of the Data Science Master Degree.
We used R to analyse a superstore dataset (a dataset with informations about the sellings of a superstore over 4 years), and to create models that could predict the sales based on the other features (such as the product type, quantity, discount, etc).
